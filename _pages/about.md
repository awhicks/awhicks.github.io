I am a fourth year PhD student at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/) advised by [Dr. Cliff Shaffer](https://people.cs.vt.edu/shaffer/) and [Dr. Stephen Edwards](https://people.cs.vt.edu/~edwards/). I recieved my B.S. in Computer Science and History from the University of Virginia. 

My research interests are broadly in computer science education and software engineering. For my dissertation, I am interested in students' help seeking behavior related to office hour interactions, how both students and TAs prepare for them, and what factors impact how students and TAs perceive these interactions. It is important to ensure these opportunities support and welcome students of diverse backgrounds to encourage their persistence in computer science.

I also work on the [OpenDSA](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/) eTextbook project, providing backend maintenance and server-side improvements including containerization and scalability upgrades as well as the [SPLICE](https://cssplice.github.io) project, working on smart learning content protocols and computer science education infrastructure.
